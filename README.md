# FakeBlitz_AI_Capstone_Project

**Objective:** To combat counterfeit products in the sneaker industry, FAKEBLITZ proposes the implementation of an AI-based solution that aims to detect counterfeit sneakers with a high degree of accuracy.

**Solution Overview:** The company's objective is to develop a multiplatform solution that can achieve a success rate of nearly 99 percent by leveraging the capabilities of ML algorithms such as Naïve Bayes Classifier and Deep Learning. Specifically, the solution will manifest as a mobile application that utilizes colour detection, sneaker texture, and logo recognition to differentiate between authentic and counterfeit sneakers.

**Comprehensive Approach:** In this project, FAKEBLITZ is not only concerned with identifying counterfeit sneakers but also with satisfying the needs of various stakeholders. The development team will be responsible for implementing the AI solution and generating results. Footwear companies potentially affected by the identification of counterfeit products and the investors or funders who have a financial stake in the success of FAKEBLITZ are also critical stakeholders. Additionally, other stakeholders may include regulatory bodies and government agencies responsible for enforcing anti-counterfeiting laws and protecting intellectual property rights.

**Key Components:**
- AI-based counterfeit sneaker detection solution
- Mobile application with colour detection, sneaker texture, and logo recognition capabilities
- ML algorithms, including Naïve Bayes Classifier and Deep Learning
- Comprehensive stakeholder engagement and satisfaction strategy

**Expected Outcome:** By successfully implementing this AI-based solution, FAKEBLITZ aims to significantly reduce the presence of counterfeit sneakers in the market, protecting both consumers and legitimate footwear companies. The multiplatform mobile application is envisioned to provide users with a seamless and accurate means of identifying authentic products. Ultimately, FAKEBLITZ's solution targets a near 99 percent success rate in counterfeit detection.

Through collaboration with various stakeholders, FAKEBLITZ endeavors to foster a robust and trusted ecosystem where authenticity is upheld, leading to greater consumer trust and enhanced brand reputation for legitimate footwear companies. Additionally, investors and funders are expected to benefit from the project's success, driving further innovation and expansion of FAKEBLITZ's AI-based solutions.

As part of its commitment to combating counterfeiting, FAKEBLITZ aims to cooperate with regulatory bodies and government agencies to ensure compliance with anti-counterfeiting laws and contribute to the protection of intellectual property rights.

By amalgamating advanced technologies with a comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategy, FAKEBLITZ endeavors to create a powerful impact in the sneaker industry and set new standards in the fight against counterfeiting.
